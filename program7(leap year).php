  /* 
    Program to find Leap year or not

    Given an integer input for an year, the objective is to check whether the given integer input represents a 
    Leap year or not. In order to do so weâ€™ll check for two conditions, any year to be a leap year must satisfy 
    either of them.

    Conditions for a Leap Year
    For any year to be a leap year it must satisfy either of these conditions
    1. Year must be divisible by 400.
    2. Year must be divisible by 4 and not by 100 at the same time.

  elseif($year%4==0 && $year%100 != 0){
    echo "$year is Leap Year<br>";
  }
  else{
    echo "$year is not year<br>";
